# Project Renzan

## Goal

The goal of milestone 1 is to produce a minimum *Operating System* (rather than a just a naked kernel). 

To be more specifically, there should be:

- Working Kernel (Obviously)

- A Working Shell (oksh or dash)

- Renzan-Specific Cross-Compiling Toolchain (binutils, gcc and/or llvm)

- Libc (enough to support components above)

## How to contribute

This branch serves as a snapshot of latest working version. Please submit contribution to component specific branches to keep a clean commit history.
